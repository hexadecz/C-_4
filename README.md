1. Create a Class Time that has three data members (hours, minutes,
seconds) provide two constructors for this class one default and the
other accepts three parameters as an input (24h format), provide a
method to print time in 24 hours format and another one for printing
time in 12 hours format.


2. Create an employee class. Items to include as data members are
employee number, name, date of hire, and monthly salary. Include
appropriate constructors in addition to getters and setters for all
instance variables. Create a ConvertString() method to return all data
members. Then write a method CalculateTax that returns 0.1 * salary.
Test your class in the main method.


3. Create a class called Shape.
Use floating-point variables to represent the private data of the class (length
and width). It has properties for both length and width. The set accessors

should verify that length and width are each floating-point number are non-
negative value.

Provide public methods for each of the following:
a) Create a method that will check if the shape is rectangle or square.
b) Overload the plus (+) to add the length of 2 shapes together, and also the
width of 2 shapes together to form a new shape object.
To test your class, instantiate 3 objects called shape1, shape2, shape3. Where
shape3 will be the sum of both shape1 and shape2. Then display to the user if
shape3 is square or rectangle.
